# Proposal for RustFest Paris

## Metadata

__Title__: What can we learn from the Meaning of Types?  
__Session Format__: Standard Talk (30mn)  
__Tags__: Scientific, Lecture, Theory  

## Abstract

As Rust programmers, we all have an intuitive sense that types are useful, and of course, we rely on
Rust's ownership model and borrow checker to keep our programs free of data races. But what exactly
do our types _mean_? In this talk, we'll explore an ongoing effort to build an accessible formal
semantics for Rust and its application to understanding the meaning of types in Rust programs.
Further, we'll use this newfound understanding of types to explore interesting ways of enforcing
correctness and security criteria through types.

### Intended Audience

The intended audience of this talk is at least intermediate Rust programmers who have some interest
in the formal world of programming languages and type theory. We won't assume any _pre-existing_
knowledge of type theory, and the goal is really to require just general mathematical competency
(i.e. algebra).
